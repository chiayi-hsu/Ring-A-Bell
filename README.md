# Ring-A-Bell


Code for reproducing the results in the paper "Ring-A-Bell! How Reliable are Concept Removal Methods For Diffusion Models?".

## Framework of Ring-A-Bell

### ðŸ“Œ Concept Extraction
The code of **Concept Extraction** is in ```Get_Concept_Vector.ipynb```.
### ðŸ“Œ Prompt Discovery
The code of **Prompt Discovery** is in ```InversePrompt.ipynb```.
<br>
<br>
You can get the problematic prompts after you conduct ```InversePrompt.ipynb```. Then you can use problematic prompts to evaluate the effectiveness of the concept removal methods.
