### 📌 Concept Extraction
The code of **Concept Extraction** is in "Get_Concept_Vector.ipynb".
### 📌 Prompt Discovery
The code of **Prompt Discovery** is in "InversePrompt.ipynb".
<br>
<br>
You can get the problematic prompts after you conduct "InversePrompt.ipynb". Then you can use problematic prompts to evaluate the effectiveness of the concept removal methods.
